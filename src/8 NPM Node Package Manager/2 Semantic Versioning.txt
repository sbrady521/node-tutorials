Semantic Versioning: (semver)
===================

Specifying what version a set of code is.

so others can track if a new version has come out.
This allows us to watch for new features, or to watch for 'breaking changes'.

The word 'semantic' implies that something conveys meaning.


Major.minor.patch
 1   .  7  .  2

Major => Big Changes.
Minor => Added new features.
Patch => some bugs were fixed.

Increment patch no if some bugs were fixed ( 1.7.3 )

Your code will work fine.

Increment a minor update ( 1.8.0 )

Some new features added. Your code will work fine.

Increment major update ( 2.0.0 )

Your code will not work fine and it will break(maybe). Big Changes
