Addresses and Ports:
===================

Port:
-----

	Once a computer receives a packet, how it knows what program to send it to.

	When a program is setup in a OS to receive packet from a particular port which is just a number.

	Means the program is listening to that port.

	Each web server has multiple Protocols running inside it. 

	So we assign a port number which is unique in web server through which data is received.

	78.132.160.4:443(IP:Port)
	Socket Address

	Domain name maps to a number and port.
