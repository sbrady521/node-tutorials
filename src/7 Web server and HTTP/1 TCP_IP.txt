TCP/IP:
-------

Protocol:
--------

	A set of rules two sides agree on to use when communicating.

	Both client and server are programmed to understand and use the particular set of rules.

	It's similar to two people from different countries agreeing on a language to speak in.

Client-server model:
--------------------

Client asks for services and server performs some services.

How the client and the server identify each other.

Client makes a request and response is given by the server

Both are done in a same format called 'HTTP'.

Client and server's have an IP address.

IP will be the identifier.

Computer opens a socket through which data flow bi-directionally.


Some sample protocols are HTTP(web),FTP(files),SMTP(emails).

The way in which the data is sent is called TCP(Transmission Control Protocol).

TCP tells the computer to split the data into pieces and those individual pieces are called 'Packets'

TCP is similar to a Stream.

Web socket is to keep the socket open.
