Lets build a module:
====================

greet.js is independent from other files and code and can be reused.

require() is function and the param is a string

string contains the name/location of the module you wish to use/import in this file.

I NEED THIS
I REQUIRE THIS

Path:
======

	./ => means the same location/folder level 

	code in greet.js is protected and is not available to the app.js

	greet() function available to app.js

	make it available globally we use module.exports

	I choose what becomes available outside of my module for use.

	Now this module is exposing the greet function.

	module is just a JS file.
