Module Patterns:
================

	module.exports.greet // reaching down module.exports to get the function.

	whatever we put in module.exports will be cached and it will be returned!

	Revealing module pattern:
	=========================

	exposing only the properties and methods you want via an returned object.

	A very common and clean way to structure and protec code with modules.

	return an object from a require will be cached and any other call to the require function will give you the same object.
