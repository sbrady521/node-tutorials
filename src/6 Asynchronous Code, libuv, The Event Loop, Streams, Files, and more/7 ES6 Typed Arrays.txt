ES6 Typed Arrays:
=================

	Latest version of JS and ES6.

	JS doesn't good ways to deal with binary data.

	Buffers deal with binary data in Node.js

	

	var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);
	var view = new Int32Array(buffer);

	view[0] = 5;
	view[1] = 10;
	view[2] = 20;


	console.log(view); // shows only 5 and 10
