Buffers:
=========


Temporary holding spot where we hold data moving from one place to another.

Buffer stores raw binary data. (0 and 1's).

Convert between buffers and string.

store strings as binary data in a buffer using binary encoding.

Default character encoding is UTF8.

most times buffers are something that's coming back from somether utility or object.




Stream:
=======

Sequence of data made availabe over time.

Pieces of data that combine into a whole.


Data comes through the stream and that is held in buffer for sometime and is send out for processing.





var buf = new Buffer('Hello','utf8');
console.log(buf);
console.log(buf.toString());
console.log(buf.toJSON());

console.log(buf[2]);

buf.write('wrodl');
console.log(buf.toString());
