Pipes:
======

	Connect two streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another.

	In Node, you pipe from a Readable stream to a writeable stream.

	Read a chunk and pipe it to a writeable stream.

	if the writeable stream is also Readable then we can pipe to another writeable stream.

	Pipes can be chained or connected.

	Sending data from Readable to writeable stream as each chunk is processed is common.

	Pipe is avaiable on readable stream.

	Readable stream can be piped only to a writeable stream.

	zlib => part of node core. used to produce Gzip files.

Method Chaining:
================

A method returns an object 	so that we can keep calling methods.

sometimes it returns the parent object (called 'cascading/chaining') and sometimes other objects.

Always use stream and async approach in node.js
