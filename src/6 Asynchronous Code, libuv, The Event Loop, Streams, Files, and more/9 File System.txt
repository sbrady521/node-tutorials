File System:
============

File system is used to handle file system in out local disk.


Sync means synchronous approach to reading a file.

synchronous approach to reading files.


readFileSync means it  when line of code is run by JS engine, it will wait till the buffer is filled.

It has the string back before the v8 engine can go on to next line of code.

Many users waiting for file to be read.


libuv asks the OS to do the work (such as fetching a file), when the OS is done with an event, places it in event loop and when it done, do a callback.


JS code will keep running, event loop will keep checking. and when the file is done reading, now you can run the callback.


when js code is done with other code, it will invoke this callback.

When invoking the function, if error, calls the error or else it will be null.

Error First Callback:
====================

callbacks that take an error object as their first parameter.

null if no error occurs, otherwise will contain an object defining the error.

This is a standard in what order to place our params for our callbacks.

Error first callbacks for an async code.

---------------------------------------
what comes back by default is a buffer.
---------------------------------------
***************************************
It gives a buffer full of binary data.
***************************************
convert it to a string using .toString()

or specify the character encoding. ( UTF-8)

Always use async approach rather than using synchronous approach.

Buffer using to load file

Buffer is just data sitting in memory called Heap in v8. spot where data sits.

If Buffers starts to fill, it can take more memory.
