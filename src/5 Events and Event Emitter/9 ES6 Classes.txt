ES6 Classes:
=============

A new way to build Objects from syntax point of view

Syntatic Sugar:

	A feature thatonly changes how you type something, but nothing changes under the hood.

	It's important to understand what is happening under the hood, so we don't make decision based on flawed assumptions.


	class Person {
		constructor(firstname,lastname){
			this.firstname = firstname;
			this.lastname = lastname;
		}
		greet(){
			console.log('Hello' + this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname);
		}
	}


	class in other prog langs is completely different from ES6 JS classes.

	new developer's doesn't know what is Prototype.
