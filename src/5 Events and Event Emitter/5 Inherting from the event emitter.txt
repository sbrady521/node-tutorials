Inherting from the event emitter:
===================================


	Let's assume we have obj2 with prop1 and prop2

	Then we have Obj1 which should have access to obj2's prop1 and prop2

	What node's inherits function does using function constructor and object.create.
	
	Those 2 objs are linked using Prototype.
