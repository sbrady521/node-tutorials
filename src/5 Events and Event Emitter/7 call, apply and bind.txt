call, apply and bind:
=====================

All functions in JS have access to 


	call() - lets you control what this variable points to and params separated by commas
	apply() - invokes the function with this and an array of parameters.
	bind() - creates a copy of the function you are calling it on and what ever methods you pass it on.
