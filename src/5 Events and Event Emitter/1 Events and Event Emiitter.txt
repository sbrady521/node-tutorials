	Custom Events:
	==============

		Inside JS Core.

		Events that the user can create for himself.

		Event Emitter contains the code for what's called Event Emitter.

		Event Emitter in code is where we have custom code.



		libuv sends event that happen inside the comp system.

		When a event occurs in libuv, it generates a custom event in JS to make it easier for us to manage our code.

		JS side is faking it.
